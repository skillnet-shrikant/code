	<h2>Base CSS</h2>
	<p>We are using <code>_normalize.css</code> to reset styles of html elements for better cross-browser rendering. On top of that, there is <code>_base.scss</code> in which we set the base font styles, box-sizing, and images to 100% so they're stretchy and fill their containers.</p>
	<p>In <code>_base.scss</code> we set the body background, the default body font (face, size, weight, and color), and the base link color and decoration. Font face, sizes and weight variables are stored in <code>_typography.scss</code>. Colors are found in <code>_colors.scss</code></p>
