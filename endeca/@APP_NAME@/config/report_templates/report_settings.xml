BEGIN DOCUMENTATION


This settings file lets you:
- disable particular report items, or entire report sections
- specify the values of N for "Top N" report items
- specify the size of the session queue that's used for conversion rate
  report items. (A larger number results in more accurate conversion rate
  calculations, but uses more memory.)
  
Here is a sample configuration:

	<report_settings>
		<disable list="conv_rate_summ, top_search_terms_dym_engaged" />
		<top_n report_item="top_search_terms_no_results" n="5, 10, 25, 50" initial_value="25" />
		<top_n report_item="top_autocorrected_terms" n="10, 25, 50" initial_value="10" />
		<session_queue size="5000" />
	</report_settings>

Here is a list of IDs for report sections and the report items they contain, 
which you can use in <disable> and <top_n> elements. (This list is for reference
purposes only - changes to this list will have no effect.)
